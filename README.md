AzureMMOQuests is a custom powerful and versatile plugin for Minecraft Servers, that allows users to create and manage a quests system within their server. 

This plugin is specifically designed for **AzureMC Network 2.0**.

## Work in progress
The plugin is still in a decidedly primitive stage of development. For this reason, it does not yet have all the features and optimizations, which will be released at the end of the project, as well as at the official release.
